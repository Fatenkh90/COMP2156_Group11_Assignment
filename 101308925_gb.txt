George Brown (1818-1880) was a 19th-century Scottish-born Canadian politician, newspaper publisher (he founded The Globe, precursor to The Globe and Mail) 
and was one of the Fathers of Confederation. An essential figure in the formation of Canada, Brown was a strong believer in public education.
George Brown opened in 1968, but our history stretches back to the early 1950s with the formation of two provincial organizations that later amalgamated 
to form the college.
