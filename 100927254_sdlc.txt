DevOps—the amalgamation of development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams—is 
an organizational approach that enables faster development of applications 
and easier maintenance of existing deployments.

DevOps is not a technology per se, 
but it covers everything from the organisation to culture, processes and tooling.
